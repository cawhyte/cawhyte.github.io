One of the hardest decisions I've ever made was deciding what I wanted to be when I grew up. If you had asked me that as a child I probably would have told you I wanted to be a veterinarian, a lawyer or an actress. I would have never said a computer programmer!

As life progressed, I followed a course of trying on many different career hats and ultimately becoming an elementary school teacher. Although I cherished my career and knew that what I did would ultimately change lives I still longed for a career that would allow me to grow creatively and financially. 

Growing up in a low-income environment I developed a secret obsession with the online world back in the early 2000's because it allowed me an opportunity to escape what was around me. As MySpace and Blackplanet began to bloom, I used those online media spaces as a creative outlet by learning how to self-design my own pages using HTML code. At the time, I had no clue that I would ever be able to create a career out of coding. As the years progressed and technology became more advanced I still only thought of learning code as a hobby and dabbled with CodeAcademy on and off. It became apparent to me as I hit my fifth year teaching that I was ready for a change. 

I began doing research on "most rewarding careers" and "jobs that are always in demand", and surprisingly saw that many of the jobs listed were those in technology and specifically in computer programming. I then began to read about the need and desire for more women and people of color to become a part of the technological industry. Something clicked for me and I knew that computer programming is what I should be doing. Even with that feeling, I began seeking out free coding resources like FreeCodeCamp to get my feet wet and really decide if programming was something I could see myself doing before paying for courses. 

I found that once I started coding projects and applying what I learned I was hooked. I knew that I have not only found a way to change my life but once I'm a full fledged programmer I've also found a way to help change the life of others.
