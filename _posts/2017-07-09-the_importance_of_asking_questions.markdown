When I started my journey on [Learn.co](learn.co) I knew that coding would be hard but I just knew that I could probably make it through the courses without using the "Ask a Question" feature. Little did I know, I began using that feature much sooner than I had anticipated. 

The first time I used the "Ask a Question" was in variables lab "Tic Tac Toe Board". At first, I was disappointed that I used the feature much sooner than I wanted too but then I realized that asking questions is essential to learning and mastering a subject that I don't really know anything about and I shouldn't be ashamed or afraid to ask questions. 


Since using the "Ask a Question" feature, I've actually made friends with a couple other students who initially answered my questions. I thoroughly enjoy knowing that I am not the only one who has questions about particular labs or understanding concepts in general. 

In a recent screen share with a tech coach, I was able to get feedback on the formatting of my code and general tips to help me better understand what I'm learning, Rubber Ducky anyone?
This feedback was so critical to me because I needed the reassurance that my lack of confidence in answering some technical questions asked by the tech coach was normal and most importantly OKAY. I left that conversation feeling empowered, motivated to continue learning and plugging away at coding.

Asking questions while learning online is like a peanut butter and banana sandwich, two things that sound like they don't automatically go together but when they're combined epic awesomeness is created.
